## Report Data on a Residential Facility


The purpose of this site is to collect data on non-governmental residential facilities that extrajudicially (without a court order) incarcerate minors.

Facilitydata.org is a project of [No Stone Unturned Federated Church](https://nsuchurch.org).

It is our intent to share data collected through this site (once redacted and as allowable by law) with other trusted entities who have publicly expressed a committment to stopping the troubled teen industry from causing further harm to children and teens.
